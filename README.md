# 📊 Power BI Dashboards – Swiggy Instamart & Zomato Food Delivery

## 🚀 What I Learned from This Project
- How to **translate business questions into KPIs**, not just visuals  
- Cleaning and shaping raw data using **Power Query**
- Writing **basic DAX measures** for totals, averages, and ratios
- Designing dashboards that are **interactive and easy to read**
- Understanding how **city type, customer behavior, and payment methods** impact sales
- Why fewer, clearer visuals tell a **better story than overcrowded dashboards**

---

This repository contains **two interactive Power BI dashboards** that I built while learning and practicing Power BI using **simulated datasets** inspired by Swiggy Instamart and Zomato Food Delivery.

The goal was to move beyond tutorial-style dashboards and focus on **practical analysis and business-focused insights**.
